# Static Analysis:

Static code analysis, is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program. The process provides an understanding of the code structure and can help ensure that the code adheres to industry standards. Static analysis is used in software engineering by software development and quality assurance teams.

# Static Analysis Tools:

Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.
